                    FAQ: In which order should you learn?...
                    
                    AWS Cloud: Start with AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate, then move on to AWS Certified Developer Associate and then AWS Certified SysOps Administrator. Afterwards you can either do AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional or AWS Certified DevOps Professional, or a specialty certification of your choosing.
                    
                    
                    
                    Apache Kafka: Start with Apache Kafka for Beginners, then you can learn Connect, Streams and Schema Registry if you're a developer, and Setup and Monitoring courses if you're an admin. Both tracks are needed to pass the Confluent Kafka certification.
